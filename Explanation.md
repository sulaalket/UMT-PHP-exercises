The Sign-up Form exercise teaches us how to create a form for users to sign up. We validate the form input on both the client and server sides to ensure correctness. 
It covers fields like name, surname, username, password, and email. We display error messages if there are any issues or confirm successful submissions.

The File Upload exercise builds on the Sign-up Form by allowing users to upload profile pictures. We modify the form and handle file uploads in the PHP script. 
Validations are performed to check file format, size, and type. If successful, the uploaded file is saved, and a confirmation page is displayed along with other form data.

The File Reading and Modification exercise demonstrates reading a file's content and modifying it using PHP. 
It replaces numbers in the file with "#" signs and writes the modified data to another file. This exercise provides a foundation for basic file operations in PHP.
